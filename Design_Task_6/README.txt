Problem 2: 
The "exsim.slx" has been tested using Matlab R2023b
and it should work with some older Matlab versions too. 

To have right data for your group in simulation, open
exsim.slx in Simulink and click from popup menu "Model properties", 
go to Call backs/InitFcn and set the variable "group" 
equal to your group number.
